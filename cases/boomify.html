					<h2>Project Background</h2>
				</div>
				<div data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-offset="100" data-aos-delay="100">
					<p>Boomify is an app that encourages and educates people to follow a
						 plastic free lifestyle.</p>
				</div>


				<h2>problem</h2>

				
				<div class="sec-text" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-offset="100" data-aos-delay="100">
					<p>The world is facing a plastic crisis. Plastic pollution has become a global concern, 
						as our planet is drowning in plastic litter and microplastics. While plastic has
						 many valuable uses, societies have become highly dependent on single-use or 
						 disposable plastic — with severe environmental consequences.</p>
				</div>


				<h2>Opportunity</h2>

				
				<div class="sec-text" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-offset="100" data-aos-delay="100">
					<p>Why don't we create a digital solution where we can encourage people
						 to reduce their dependency on single-use or disposable plastic usage.
						<br> <br>
					
						Boomify aims to educate people on the importance and impact of reducing plastic and
						 rewarding them for cutting back on their plastic usage. Users will be able 
						 to gain points as a reward by participating in quizzes, reading articles, 
						 and buying environment-friendly products. 
						</p>
				</div>


				<h2>User research</h2>

				
				<div class="sec-text" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-offset="100" data-aos-delay="100">
					<p>Due to time constraints, I started my research by going through the analogous 
						apps which offer similar services to see how they do in the market and the
						 features they offer. and conducted online research to see how we can 
						 leverage technology to reduce plastic pollution and how recycling helps.<br><br>
						
						 “Only 9% of all plastic produced by humanity has been recycled and only 14% of
						  plastic waste is currently being collected for recycling, and it is increasingly 
						  seen as having huge potential to tackle the plastic crisis. However, plastic
						   recycling presents huge challenges due to the nature of the material itself.”

						   <br><br>

						   The focus of my app was to educate people about the environmental 
						   consequences caused by the plastic pollution and create opportunities 
						   to be part of sustainable life and contribute to the climate change
						    problem by promoting environment-friendly products.
							<br><br>

							As part of defining my target audience, I went through a couple of surveys 
							that indicate the age group of people who consumes a large number of single-use
							 or disposable plastic materials.

							 <br><br>

							 after analyzing the survey insight I have decided to go with a visualized dashboard 
							 or similar patterns where we show the amount of impact that a person’s reduction
							  of plastic is making on our environment. for encouraging them to do more I introduced 
							  a reward system where their actions within the app such as participating on quizzes, 
							  removing plastic material from their day to day life environment and buying 
							  environment-friendly products help earn points that add up to an overall reward.

					<h4>My space:</h4>
					<p>
						
						<br><br>
						in this section, users can add what plastic product they want to remove
						 from their day-to-day life and get a reward for their actions.
						 <br><br>
						
						</p>

                
						<h4>Quizzes:</h4>
					<p>
						
						<br><br>
						Quizzes are part of an education system where we not only educate the people a
						bout environmental awareness but give them rewards to motivate them to do more.

						 <br><br>
						
						</p>

						<h4>Shop:</h4>
					<p>
						
						<br><br>
						unlike competitors where they teach awareness of recycle I wanted the people to 
						reduce the use of plastics so introduced a shop within the app where they can 
						purchase environment-friendly products.

						 <br><br>
						
						</p>


						<h4>Profile/analytics:</h4>
					<p>
						
						<br><br>
						Users are able to see how their actions make changes to the envirment and 
						redeem the points they earn to buy plastic free products.
